        <b>A web page is a digital document that is part of a website, which can be accessed through a web browser. It's a fundamental unit of content on the World Wide Web and is typically written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), although it may also include CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.
        <br>Here are some key aspects of a web page:</b>

        <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of a web page. It uses a system of tags and elements to define headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and other elements on a page.</li>

        <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to style the visual presentation of a web page. It defines how elements on the page should be displayed, including their layout, colors, fonts, and more. CSS can be linked externally or embedded within the HTML document.</li>

        <li>JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It can be used to create interactive forms, respond to user actions, and manipulate the content of a web page in real-time.</li>

        <li>Content: The content of a web page can vary widely, from text and images to videos, audio, and interactive elements. The content is what users see and interact with when they visit a web page.</li>

        <li>Web Hosting: To make a web page accessible on the internet, it needs to be hosted on a web server. Web hosting services provide the infrastructure and resources necessary to serve web pages to users.</li>

        Web pages are the building blocks of websites, and they can be as simple as a single static page or as complex as a dynamic web application with multiple interconnected pages. The design and functionality of a web page depend on the specific goals and requirements of the website it belongs to.</li>
